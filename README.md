## Detailed Report: Analysis of the Executed Jupyter Notebook

# Executive Summary
This report analyzes the Jupyter notebook file "walmart_sales_prediction.ipynb", executed in a Google Colab environment. The notebook is designed as a foundation for Walmart weekly sales forecasting using time series data. It includes comprehensive library imports for data handling, visualization, statistical time series modeling, deep learning, and additive forecasting, followed by loading the "Walmart DataSet.csv" file and displaying the first few rows.
# Key Findings:
1. Purpose: Setup for multivariate time series forecasting of weekly sales, incorporating economic (CPI, Unemployment), environmental (Temperature, Fuel_Price), and holiday factors.
2. Execution Status: Successful up to data loading and preview (execution counts 6–11). No errors occurred, but the notebook is incomplete — no EDA, modeling, or evaluation cells are executed.
3. EDA: Intended but not implemented; imports suggest plots, correlations, and decomposition.
Models: Imports for ARIMA, SARIMAX, Prophet, and LSTM are present, but no models were trained or evaluated.
4. Results: No model results, forecasts, or performance metrics are generated in the executed notebook.
5. Strengths: Strong foundation with a wide range of forecasting tools.
Limitations: Incomplete code; truncated document; no actual analysis beyond data preview.
Recommendations: Add EDA, model training, evaluation, and visualization to complete the forecasting pipeline.
